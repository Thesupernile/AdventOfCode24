# AdventOfCode2024
Collection of Solutions to Advent Of Code 2024

Each program file is a solution to a different day's challenge, all completed using c++
A copy of the task given for each day is included under /docs/tasks
In each file, the first part of the challenge is solved in the Part1() function and the second part of the challenge is solved in the Part2() function. Most of the challenges will output both results as well as a short description telling the user what the program is supposed to be doing
Some solutions may take a short period of time to complete their calculation of the result. Don't worry, this is normal (although not a good thing)

My goal through this challenge was to get a good start in using c++ programming and develop my skills for more challenging projects in the future
