# AdventOfCode2024
This repositry contains a collection of my solutions to Advent Of Code 2024.

Each program file is a solution to a different day's challenge, all completed using C++.
A copy of the task given for each day is included under /docs/tasks.
In each file, the first part of the challenge is solved in the Part1() function and the second part of the challenge is solved in the Part2() function. Most of the challenges will output both results as well as a short description telling the user what the program is supposed to be doing.
Some solutions may take a short period of time to complete their calculation of the result. Don't worry, this is normal (although not a good thing).

My goal through this challenge was to get a good start in using C++ programming and develop my skills for more challenging projects in the future.

# Example
Take day 6 as an example challenge. The program input is a map (stored as a series of strings) and the challenge is to determine how many distinct positions are visited by a guard (shown by the ^ on the map) will vist before he leaves the map entirely. Part two asks you to determine how many places on the map there are where you could place an obsticle to force the guard into an infinate loop.

The output for this challenge would look like:
